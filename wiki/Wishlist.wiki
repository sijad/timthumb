Below is a list of features that 'may' be implemented at some unspecified stage in the future (I don't like to promise anything).

==Wishes==

  * increase memory usage for large images (user definable)
  * allow for disabling of image output. Will allow image resizing (pre-caching) without display. Good for administration and batch processing
  * default image for broken image urls
  * option to crop and not scale
  * optional settings file
  * watermark (user definable text in bottom right)
  * user definable percentage for crop location (as detailed on [http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2010/08/timthumb-part-4-moving-crop-location/comment-page-1/#comment-31799 Binary Moon])

==Wish Granted==

  * user definable image size limits (to prevent malicious usage)
  * clear out cached image if image has been replaced
  * user definable external sites to resize images from other domains
  * support transparency in images (png and gif)
  * a new setting which allows a single dimension to be specified and the second dimension to be calculated accordingly (to scale images)
  * image filters
  * image sharpening
