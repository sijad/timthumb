A small php script for cropping, zooming and resizing web images (jpg, png, gif). Perfect for use on blogs and other applications.

Developed for use in the WordPress theme [Mimbo Pro](http://prothemedesign.com/themes/mimbo/), and since used in many other WordPress themes.

You can read more about the script, along with TimThumb tutorials, on the [TimThumb Project Homepage](http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/projects/timthumb/)
